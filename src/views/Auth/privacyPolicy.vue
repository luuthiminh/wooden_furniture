      <h2>4. COLLECTION OF OTHER DATA</h2>
      <p>
        4.1 Like most other websites and mobile applications, your device sends
        information that may include data about you, recorded by a web server
        when you use our platform. This information usually includes but is not
        limited to the IP address, computer/device operating system, browser
        type, mobile device type, mobile device characteristics, Unique Device
        Identifier (UDID), or Mobile Device Identifier (MEID) of your mobile
        device, the referring web page (if any), the pages you have accessed on
        our website or mobile app, and the time of access, and sometimes
        "cookies" (which can be disabled using your browser's options) to help
        the website remember your last visit. If you log in, this information is
        linked to your personal account. This information is also included in
        anonymous statistical data to help us understand how visitors use our
        website.

        share your location with other users as part of the services provided by

        content and advertisements and access other software on our platform or
        through our services, information may be sent to us (including but not
        limited to, IP address, operating system, etc.). However, instead of

        advertisements viewed and/or software installed by the services and
        platform and the time.

        7. HOW DOES LUẬN LÊN FURNITURE STORE PROTECT AND STORE CUSTOMER

      </h2>
      <p>
        7.1 We implement various security measures and always strive to ensure
        the safety of your personal data on our systems. User personal data is
        stored behind security networks and can only be accessed by a limited

      </p>
      <p>
        7.2 We will maintain personal data in accordance with the privacy laws
        and/or other prevailing laws and regulations. This means that we will
        delete or remove identifying information from your personal data when we
        receive your request in accordance with the provisions of current
        privacy laws or when we have a reasonable basis to determine that (i)
        the storage of that personal data no longer serves the purpose of
        collecting that personal data; (ii) the retention is no longer necessary
        for any legitimate or business purpose, and (iii) there are no other
        legitimate interests to continue storing such personal data. If you stop

        are terminated or canceled, we may continue to store, use, and/or
        disclose your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and
        our obligations under privacy laws. Depending on legal regulations, we
        may safely dispose of your personal data without prior notice to you.

        7.3 We reserve the right to refuse deletion or disposal of data in cases
        where your request does not comply with the provisions of the current
        privacy laws, or, although appropriate, falls within cases where we are
        not required to delete or dispose of data according to the provisions of
        the current privacy laws.
